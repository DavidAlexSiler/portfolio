                <p>
                    I'm a former bartender turned software engineer. I can think quickly on my 
                    feet, and can always find a way to use my natural creativity to get a task 
                    finished. 
                </p>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        I'm not all business.. After hours you can find me either skateboarding,
                        snowboarding, or playing synths with my dogs. 

                    </p>
                </div>
        </div>
    )
